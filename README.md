# Nextjs elysia router example

Elysia can be used as a replacement for Next.js API routes, but with some caveats.

> It's important to note that Elysia is not a drop-in replacement for Next.js API routes, and some features (like Middleware and getServerSideProps integration) may not work as expected.

However, if you are looking for a lightweight, type-safe, and fully-featured web framework for use with Next.js, Elysia is a great choice. Here's a basic guide to get you started.

## Elysia docs

Basic usage example can be found at [elysiajs docs](https://elysiajs.com/integrations/nextjs.html)
